# Practice work: Demographics of Best CS Scientists Worldwide Data Analysis
In this practice project, I did some data analysis on the best CS scientists from all over the world & visualized them on Tableau 

This was the [dataset](https://github.com/RezuwanHassan262/Tableau-Practice-work-Demographics-of-Best-CS-Scientists-Worldwide/blob/main/best_cs_scientist_details.csv).

This project aimed to practice & learn to use Tableau. I tried to get some insights into the data like,

1. Average publications of all the countries and which country is in the leading position out of all the countries.
2. European countries with the number of scientists on a map (exclude Russia)
3. Which Middle Eastern universities are good at research?
4. Which column or feature is directly correlated with the World Rank column

Tried to visualize all these in the popular data visualization tool, Tableau.


Here's the link to the Tableau Dashboard for the scraped data: Earthquake Data Tableau Dashboard [4 Sheets & 1 Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/md.reuzwan.hassan/viz/PracticeworkDemographicsofBestCSScientistsWorldwide/DemographicsofBestCSScientistsWorldwide)
